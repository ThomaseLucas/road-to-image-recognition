# 🧠 Road to implementing image recognition

Welcome! This repository documents my journey of learning **Neural Networks**, **Image Recognition**, and **Machine Learning** from the ground up — all without relying on high-level libraries like Keras or PyTorch (at least not at first 😉).

## 🎯 Goal

To build a functional **image recognition system from scratch**, understand the theory behind it, and document the entire process as a self-taught, hands-on machine learning engineer.

## 📌 Why This Exists

I wanted to prove that with consistent daily effort (30–60 min/day), it’s possible to go from **basic programming and calculus** to building a full-fledged image recognizer—and to **inspire others** who want to do the same.

> This is not just a tutorial—it’s a **learning journal** in code.
